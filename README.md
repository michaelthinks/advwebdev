# Developer Samples
This repository contains code samples for professional review. These samples were developed over the course of my college and professional career and serve as samples for future employers/recruiters.

Movies List (MovieDB Sample)

Movies List is a single page web application that dynamically displays movie data from The Movie DB (TMDb). This application is build using Javascript, jQuery, Mustasche.js, HTML5, CSS3, and is self contained within a single HTML file. It allows for searching for movies with some simple filtering options, searching for movies by a specific actor, as well as other features. This was built as a semester-end project.

Google Books List (Google Play Books Sample)

Google Books List is a sister project to Movies List. Whereas Movies List was built as a semester-end project, Google Books List was built throughout the entire semester as a way to learn and experiment with the different technologies covered throughout the semester. Google Books List uses the Google Books API to search for books and implements different front-end web development features such as pagination, overlays, etc.
